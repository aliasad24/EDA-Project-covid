Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis of COVID-19 Outbreak Data

Project Description:

This project conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 outbreak data from various sources, including the "our world data dataset" and the "COVID-19 EDA dataset." The data was cleaned and preprocessed using Python and Pandas, and summary statistics and graphical representations were created to compare total cases, vaccinations, recoveries, and deaths over time in India and worldwide. Plotly and Matplotlib were used to visualize the data and identify patterns and trends. The impact of public events and government actions on the spread of COVID-19 was also investigated. The findings of the EDA were summarized to showcase the significance of EDA in understanding and making data-driven decisions during the pandemic.

Key Findings:

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the world, with over 500 million cases and 6 million deaths reported as of March 2023.
India has been one of the countries hardest hit by the pandemic, with over 400 million cases and 600,000 deaths.
Vaccinations have played a crucial role in controlling the spread of COVID-19, but there are still many people who are not vaccinated.
Public events and government actions can have a significant impact on the spread of COVID-19. For example, the Delta variant of COVID-19 spread rapidly in India following a religious festival in October 2021.
EDA is a valuable tool for understanding and making data-driven decisions during the pandemic. By analyzing data, we can identify patterns and trends that can help us to develop effective strategies for preventing the spread of COVID-19 and mitigating its impact.

Conclusion:

In this study, the focus was on the epidemiology of COVID-19 in India and how datasets were used to unveil previously hidden trends, patterns, and linkages. Where all the data was collected from 28 states of India, the findings indicate that a social contact-based approach may easily account for both the underlying illness transmission patterns and related hazards-(including both confirmed and unconfirmed cases). To get an overlook at the total cases in India, I selected the core data which I had to analyze and it is perceptibly clear the numbers are rising exponentially, multiple reasons could play a role in the rise of cases and could be because of people aren’t quarantining at homes, not getting vaccinations, or living under poor medical conditions. Although the reason for the spike in India is unknown, it is likely due to packed events organized in the run-up to elections — President Modi himself took the campaign route on March 30, addressing electoral rallies in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Puducherry as the uptick in cases started. Large groups and social gatherings during religious holidays also contributed, as did the progressive reopening of public places and relaxation of lockdown measures throughout 2020, culminating in the complete "unlocking" of restrictions in December 2020.

The data accumulated in the beginning showed the-rising number of cases, this was taken on a serious note by the government. Where they made a significant move in influencing people to get vaccinated this had an influence on future trends as observed in (figure 2). Where new vaccinations were administered which resulted in cutting the number of new deaths.

Until June 2021, the coronavirus illness (COVID-19), found in China in December 2019, afflicted more than 171 million individuals and resulted in more than 3.5 million fatalities globally. In the long run, spread worldwide, and countries in Europe were impacted the most like Ukraine and Bulgaria. Giorgio Armani, the Italian fashion business, has canceled its forthcoming January presentations in Milan and Paris owing to an increase in Covid-19 cases throughout Europe. Another factor to look at older biological age, those who died from COVID-19 all around the world had a median age of 82 years, which means almost half of them were younger than that. COVID-19's fatality rate is highly dependent on a person's age and medical history too. Which a lot of people tended to have and resulted in escalating exponential death rate. Although the virus was new to the-humankind, it can be clearly seen the-governments- around the world along with the private healthcare sector have a successful job in encouraging people of getting the vaccination, on the way to control the situation and reduce the number of people getting affected.

This project demonstrated the value of EDA in understanding and making data-driven decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic. By analyzing data from various sources, we were able to identify patterns and trends that helped us to understand the impact of the pandemic and to develop effective strategies for preventing its spread. This project also highlighted the importance of vaccination and public health measures in controlling the spread of COVID-19.
